/**
0)The Chain of Responsibility design pattern allows for a chain of different objects (that inherit from the same class/interface), to pass on the responsibility of executing a piece of logic to another object.
1)The chain of responsibility pattern is used to process varied requests, each of which may be dealt with by a different handler.
2)the chain of responsibility pattern creates a chain of receiver objects for a request. This pattern decouples sender and receiver of a request based on type of request.
3)Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
Problem   :   Need to efficiently process the requests without hard-wiring handler relationships and precedence, or request-to-handler mappings.
Solving   :   Encapsulate the processing elements inside a "pipeline" abstraction; and have clients "launch and leave" their requests at the entrance to the pipeline.

Attention !!!:
	Do not use Chain of Responsibility when each request is only handled by one handler, or, when the client object knows which service object should handle the request.
